                    <p class="dek">As the 2023 NBA regular season has officially ended and the playoffs commence, we can take a look back at some of the games this season. On March 3rd, the Sacramento Kings beat the Los Angeles Clippers 128-127. On February 28, the Washington Wizards beat the Atlanta Hawks 119-116. Do you see a pattern yet? Let’s keep going. On February 24, the Kings passed by the Clippers 176-175. On February 4th, the Oklahoma City Thunder towered over the Rockets 153-121. Now, let’s take a deeper look at player’s performances. This season, Cleveland Cavalier and Portland Trail Blazer point guards Donnovan Mitchell and Damian Lillard each scored 71 points. Philadelphia 76er and Dallas Maverick stars Joel Embid and Luka Doncic each put up around 60 points. Any hint as to why this might be? A simple answer: high efficiency. Teams are scoring more than ever before. This season is on track to break the record for the highest offensive rating in the NBA by 1.3 points. This is partly due to the fact that NBA has become an offensive game. Let’s take a walk through the history of the NBA and examine different factors to understand why and how high efficiency has taken effect.

                    <h3> 3-point line</h3>

                    <p>First, it will be helpful to look at the creation of the 3-point line to explain the high efficiency of the game nowadays compared to the 70’s/80’s. According to the NBA, <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/3-point-era-nba-75" target="blank"> the league-wide 3-point rate(the percentage of all field goal attempts that have come from beyong the arc)has increased in each of the last 10 seasons, rising from 22.2% in 2010-11 to 39.2% last season. And it's increased more in the last five years than it did in the previous five,"(Schuhmann 1).</a> Also, the average number of made 3-pointers has almost doubled from the creation of the 3-point line to now</p>

                    <h3> Points per game </h3>

                    <p>Before the 3-point line, the NBA world was not as high-scoring compared to now. Teams would reach the early 100’s mark but nothing more. As soon as the 3-point line was implemented, the game of basketball transformed into something else. Based on my findings, the average 3-pointers per game doubled from 2014-2023. But during the same time period, the average points per game in the league increased by 14.4. Do you see a clearer pattern now? Simply put, the more 3-pointers made, the more points. </p>

                    <h3> Wilt Chamberlain to Steph Curry </h3>

                    <p>I’m sure the names Wilt Chamberlain or Steph Curry pop into your mind when the topic of points and 3-pointers is up in the air. In 1962, Chamberlain set the NBA single-game scoring record by putting up 100 points for the then Philadelphia Warriors against the New York Knicks. The other future hall of famer, Steph Curry, revolutionized the aspect of the 3-point line to a whole different level. The Golden State Warriors point guard currently holds the record for the most 3’s in NBA history: 3390. I think it’s important to understand the correlation of a player’s performance to the amount of points a team puts up in terms of explaining the high efficiency of the game. Also, it’s beneficial to see how players move with time, scoring more points now than before, as we've seen with Chamberlain and Curry. For example, let’s look at two players in back-to-back seasons who have a major James Harden. In 1998-1990, the Chicago Bulls star’s points per game only increased by 1.06. In 2017-2019, Harden’s points per game tripled from 30.43 - 36.13. This doesn’t mean that James Harden is better than Michael Jordan. It just shows how players are scoring more points per game than ever, regardless of skill level. </p>


                    <h3> Defensive efficiency stats </h3>
                    <p>Offense has been the story of the NBA these past few years. But, when do we talk about the other side of the court, the defense? First, put this into perspective: the Cleveland Cavaliers led the league this season with a 109.6 defensive rating. If the season ended today, the CAVS would have the worst defensive rating to head the league ever. How’s that for a surprising stat? The sad truth is that teams don’t want to go back to the 1980’s where gameplay was low scoring and slow. The key to winning is scoring more points because it ultimately leads to a better product.<p>

                <h3>Primary Source</h3>
                <p>Let’s stay on the defensive side of things and see what Siddique Farooqui has to say about the efficiency change in the NBA. From being a superfan of basketball to announcing games for the New York Knicks, Siddique has covered all areas of the court. He knows the ins and out of the modern day game as well as the good old days. In my interview with him, the main idea he kept bringing up time and time again was that in the 90’s, teams were allowed to defense. Well, what does he mean by “allowed.” He put it as: “If someone drove in the lane, you would have to get locked in in order to get a whistle.” This means that during the 1990’s, it was very difficult to actually draw or commit a foul on defense. Nowadays, if you get slightly shoved unintentionally, the referees could pull out the flagrant foul card. He also brought the idea of money into the conversation and said: “Defense is not prioritized anymore because it doesn’t bring in money and eyes. You know what does: scoring and offense. They are gonna get paid if someone can knock down a three.” He also talks about how it’s about what’s exciting: aka hitting three-pointers.</p>
                <p>Switching back to the offensive side, one of the biggest things we discussed was that defense has been substituted for 3-pointers. He uses Mika Antonio to help explain the reasoning behind this.  When he was the coach of the Phoenix Suns, their team had a nickname: 7 seconds or less. Sidique said this was because they would run on the floor, rush before the defense can get set, and shoot. Nowadays, every single team is doing that which is why offense is general much quicker. In his final words, Siddique emphasized that “the game has become a virtual 3-point contest now from Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry to the Boston Celtics’ Jayson Tatum.”

                    <h3>Putting it all together</h3>
                    <p>By this time, you probably have a good understanding of the increase in points per game, three pointers, and players' performances. Through all of my findings, sources, and statistics, the conclusion can be made that the game has no doubt increased in efficiency. Teams are playing and scoring at a level that has never been done before. This season, teams are scoring an average of 114.2 points per game. On April 15th, the Boston Celtics put up 74 points in jut the first half. This season is the highest scoring avaerage in the NBA since 1969. It also goes hand in hand with player's putting up 50 and 60 point games and normalizing the three-point line. All of these factors play a major role in the high efficiency and transformation of the NBA</p>
